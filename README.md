## Hi there! My name is Axia üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è!
I've been playing Minecraft for almost as far back as I can remember, focusing mainly on technical gameplay and the niche mechanics that make the game work. Throughout this time, I have had countless ideas for features I would add into the game "if I became a developer", or changes I would like to make just for the sake of seeing "what would happen if..."

Over time, this has led me down the path of modding the game using the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) engine. I picked modding up for the first time back in June of this year thanks to online tutorials, and I haven't stopped messing around since! Here is where you can find the code for all the mods I've worked on, ranging from [small "quality of life" changes](https://github.com/axialeaa/PickMoreBlocks) to a [total idea playground](https://github.com/axialeaa/DoormatCarpetExtension).

I hope you can find something you're interested in. I'm glad to have you here!
